<head><em>The Basic of Programmimg</em></head>

<p><b>Thinking like a programmer</b></p>
<b>1.Procedural Thinking</b><br>
This means creating perfectly clear, and you should make unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.<br>

<b>2.Abstract Thinking</b><br>
Finding similarity and generality among seemingly different things.<br>

<b>3.Systematic Thinking</b><br>
This happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.<br>

<b>4.Technological Thinkng</b><br>
Understanding what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing.<br>

<b>5.Systems Thinking</b><br>
Collect evidence <b>-></b> Generate theories <b>-></b> Test those theories <b>-></b>
Fix the problem<br>

<p><b>W</b>orld <b>W</b>ide <b>W</b>eb</b></p>
We call www is a collectional of HTML documents.<br>
(e.g.)<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp">w3schools.com</a>

<p><b>HTML</b></p>
means HyperText Markup Languages<br>
This is made up of <br>
<b>1.text content</b> -what you see<br>
<b>2.markup</b> -what it looks like<br>
<b>3.reference to other documents </b> -e.g. images&videos<br>
<b>4.links to other pages</b>

<p><b>inline / block</b></p>

Inline is handled as a part of text, so it doesn't generate a new paragraph.<br>
That is, a text style.
<br>
<b>{br, b, em, img, span, a, strong} tags are all inline.</b>
<br>
<br>
Block is a block. That's it!
<br>
<b>{p, div, form} tags are block.</b>

<p><b>div VS span</b></p>

div tag is a block, and this is nomally used.<br>
However, if you want to arrange some part of text, you should use span tag.
